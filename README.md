## Code Explanation

The provided code is a simplified version of the Crypto Trend Pro strategy implemented in MQL5. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. Include necessary libraries:
```
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
#include <MovingAverages\MovingAverages.mqh>
```
This code section includes the required libraries for trading and calculating moving averages.

2. Define constants:
```
#define TRADE_VOLUME 0.01
#define SLOW_MA_PERIOD 50
#define FAST_MA_PERIOD 20
```
These constants define the trade volume and the periods for the slow and fast moving averages.

3. Instantiate trade object:
```
CTrade trade;
```
This line creates an instance of the CTrade class, which will be used to execute trades.

4. Expert initialization function:
```
int OnInit()
{
    trade.Volume(TRADE_VOLUME);
    return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
}
```
This function is called when the EA is initialized. It sets the trade volume for the CTrade object.

5. Expert tick function:
```
void OnTick()
{
    double slowMA = iMA(_Symbol, 0, SLOW_MA_PERIOD, 0, MODE_SMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0);
    double fastMA = iMA(_Symbol, 0, FAST_MA_PERIOD, 0, MODE_SMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0);
    if (fastMA > slowMA)
    {
        trade.Buy();
        Comment('Bullish trend - Buying');
    }
    else if (fastMA < slowMA)
    {
        trade.CloseAll();
        Comment('Bearish trend - Closing all positions');
    }
}
```
This function is called on each tick of the market. It calculates the slow and fast moving averages using the iMA function. If the fast moving average is greater than the slow moving average, it opens a long position. If the fast moving average is less than the slow moving average, it closes all open positions.
